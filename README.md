  "Why": "I would like to be a protective agent in the CIA. The reason behind this is just because I would like the action behind this type of career. Also because it would not be like a normal job, because you would get to see more than just our country, because in this job you would protect people nation wide. People who the CIA thinks are at high risks they assign protective agents to. Now this all adds up to protecting our great Nation called The United States Of America. If we can protect people who have valuable information about a terrorists organization that plans to attack America. The CIA would assigns a protective agent to help get him to America or somewhere safe so he wouldn’t be killed. In a case like I just mention, information may be crucial to save countless lives and I would love to do something on a daily basis that I know is helping our country and keeping Americans safe."
